## ðŸ§ª Titanic Data Exploration & Modeling Questions

This notebook answers the following key questions using data analysis and machine learning:

### ðŸ“Š Data Analysis
1. How many passengers survived and how many didnâ€™t? Plot a bar chart.
2. What percentage of males vs. females survived? Use a countplot or pie chart.
3. Compare survival rate across passenger classes (Pclass). Which class had the highest survival rate?
4. Plot the age distribution. Then, compare the average age of survivors vs. non-survivors.
5. Do passengers with family (SibSp or Parch) have higher survival rates?
6. What is the survival rate for passengers who paid more than the average fare?
7. Create a new column dividing passengers into "child" (Age < 16), "adult", and "senior" (Age > 60). Which group survived the most?
8. Check for missing values in the dataset. How did you handle them before modeling?
9. Create a heatmap showing correlation between numerical columns. What insights can you draw?
10. Plot survival counts for each Embarked location (Embarked). Which location had the highest survival rate?

### ðŸ¤– Modeling with Random Forest
11. Train a Random Forest classifier and print the accuracy.
12. What happens to the accuracy when you change `n_estimators` (e.g., 10, 100, 500)?
13. Use `.predict()` to make predictions for the first 10 rows. Compare with actual survival values.
14. Plot a confusion matrix for the Random Forest model. Explain what the matrix tells you.
15. List the top 3 most important features according to the Random Forest model.
16. Use `cross_val_score` to evaluate model performance. Whatâ€™s the average accuracy across folds?
17. Try changing `max_depth` of the Random Forest. How does it affect accuracy and overfitting?
18. Compare Random Forest accuracy with a simple Decision Tree. Which performs better and why?
